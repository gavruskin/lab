*We develop mathematics and computer science necessary to answer rigorous questions about molecular data.
Our ultimate goal is achieved when we observe how molecular biology and data science shape modern mathematics and computer science.*

The lab will be launched in February 2018 as a part of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/) at [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/) in [Dunedin](https://www.dunedinnz.com/), and we are planning to recruit a few new members later that year.
Job ads will be posted soon and the positions will remain open until filled (no deadline), but do fire me an email if you are interested in doing a PhD or postdoc in New Zealand's South Island.
We are particularly interested in developing algorithm and scalable statistical methods for evolutionary data analysis, including phylogenomic methods, fitness landscape inference and analysis, genetic interactions, and other computationally demanding areas of genomics and related fields.
I would be happy to provide further details about specific projects to interested people.
We also are happy to accommodate applicants' own scientific interests and welcome informal [email](mailto:alex@gavruskin.com) enquires containing a brief outline of why you want to join our lab.
The successful applicants will be working in close collaboration with [Genomics Aotearoa](http://www.otago.ac.nz/genetics/news/otago659624.html) in New Zealand and [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en) in Germany.

The lab will have its own corner on the web but for now do watch this space and stay tuned by following me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gavruskin).
