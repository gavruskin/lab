Caitlin met Alex in May at a mini-conference in [MPI Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/), where he [presented](http://lab.gavruskin.com/talks/2017_Leipzig_MPI) the group's [recent advances](https://doi.org/10.1101/137372) in the study of genomic fitness landscapes.
In his [talk](http://lab.gavruskin.com/talks/2017_Leipzig_MPI) Alex formulated a conjecture which is a stepping stone for the development of efficient methods to infer genetic interactions from incomplete data.
Shortly after the meeting Caitlin established Alex's conjecture in full, providing an extremely efficient implementation of her method on top of the solution.
Congratulations Caitlin!
We look forward to your visit and our collaboration on this project.
Caitlin will start her PhD study at Penn State later this year, and we wish her all the best.
